/**
 * Thrown when a native call fails — a missing symbol, a null/failure return code, or a {@code Throwable} escaping
 * an {@code invokeExact}. Every binding wrapper funnels failures here so native errors are never swallowed and
 * always carry the offending call's name. See {@code docs/native-bindings.md} §4.
 *
 * <p>Not final: a native failure whose <em>recovery</em> differs in kind deserves to be told apart by type
 * rather than by parsing a message. Device loss is the case that forced it — everything built from the device
 * is gone, so a caller's response is to rebuild rather than to retry, and a subscriber several layers up needs
 * to know which of those it is looking at. Subclass only for that reason; a subclass per failing call would be
 * exactly the taxonomy this class exists to avoid.
