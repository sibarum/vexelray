/**
 * Pins the size of every layout in {@link VkStructs}, and the offset of the fields most easily got wrong.
 *
 * <h2>Why a test for constants</h2>
 *
 * <p>These layouts describe C structs that live on the other side of an FFI boundary, and nothing on this
 * side checks them. A missing {@code paddingLayout(4)} does not fail to compile, does not fail to allocate,
 * and does not fail at the call: the driver reads the bytes at the offsets its own header says, so a
 * mis-padded layout writes {@code width} where the driver looks for {@code height} — or writes a pointer
 * field half into a length field, which is the version that corrupts memory rather than merely drawing the
 * wrong picture.
 *
 * <p>That was survivable while each of these lived privately next to its one caller, because a mistake broke
 * one class. They are shared now, so a mistake breaks the windowed presenter, both offscreen paths and the
 * new {@link dev.vexelray.vulkan.present.OffscreenPresenter} at once — and the three GPU checks that would
 * catch it need a device, so on a machine without one nothing would.
 *
 * <p>The expected numbers are the sizes the Vulkan headers give on a 64-bit ABI, written as literals on
 * purpose. Deriving them from the layout would assert only that the layout equals itself.
