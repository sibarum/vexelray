/**
 * {@code VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST} — a GPU reset, a driver crash, a hot-unplugged eGPU.
 *
 * <p>Its own type because the recovery is different in kind from every other failed call. An ordinary
 * {@link NativeException} may be a bug in one call with the device still perfectly healthy; this one means
 * every {@code VkPipeline}, {@code VkBuffer}, {@code VkImage}, queue and command pool made from that device is
 * now invalid, no retry of anything helps, and the only way forward is to destroy the device and build a new
 * one. A caller that wants to tell those apart should not have to read an exception message to do it.
 *
 * <p>It is also what lets the engine publish {@code EngineEvents.DEVICE_LOST} truthfully: an event that could
 * only ever be raised by string-matching a message would be an event nobody could trust.
